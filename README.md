# Image-Recognition
This project was developed on the basis of the paper "A Semantic Segmentation Network for Urban-Scale Building Footprint Extraction Using RGB Satellite Imagery" by Jiwani et al. This repo aims at working on his model with a slight difference - conducting progressively improving train dataset size runs to the model on a single dataset [AiCrowd Mapping Challenge] to see how well the model improves progressively. Individual training dataset folders were made and annotations for them were individually updated to make the masks.

The requirements.txt file is downloaded either directly from the command line, or in case of errors popping up, we can manually install each dependency seperately and run the model.

Further details are provided in the codes.
